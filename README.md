# लक्ष्मी देवी इंटर कॉलेज — Official School Website

A complete, responsive, multi-page website for **Laxmi Devi Inter College (LDIC)**, Madhwapur, Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh — built as a pure static site (HTML/CSS/JS) with no build step, so it deploys directly on **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 Deploy on GitHub Pages (3 steps)

1. Push this entire folder's contents to a GitHub repository (e.g. `ldic-website`).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under "Build and deployment", set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder → Save.

Your site will be live at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

No npm install, no build command, no server required — it's plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🎨 Design System

- **Colours:** Saffron/Bhagwa (`#F2760F`) and gold (`#C6941E`) dominant, maroon (`#7A1E20`) for structure/nav, cream/ivory backgrounds, small dark-green accents. Blue used only as the school logo's own colour — never as a UI theme colour.
- **Typography:** *Hind* for Devanagari + general body text, *Poppins* for English headings, *Inter* for English body text — all loaded from Google Fonts.
- **Navigation:** Collapsible icon/text sidebar on desktop (persists expand/collapse choice via `localStorage`); slide-in drawer with overlay on mobile.
- **Animations:** Subtle scroll-reveal (`IntersectionObserver`), hero zoom/fade-in, hover lifts on cards/buttons — respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## ✅ Content Accuracy

All text, names, phone numbers, percentages, and photographs come directly from material supplied by the school (see `Ldic.txt` instructions). No statistics, fees, rankings, or facilities were invented. The UP Board result posters and the Taj Mahal trip photo are the **original uploaded images**, unaltered, displayed via `<img>` tags rather than recreated.

## 🎬 Homepage Promo Video

A 10-second video (`assets/videos/promo.mp4`) sits between the statistics section and the intro. It starts automatically (muted — browsers block autoplay with sound) when it scrolls into view, pauses when scrolled away, and has a small mute/unmute button at the bottom-right of the player. To change the video, replace `assets/videos/promo.mp4` (keep the same filename). If the file is missing, the section hides itself.

## 🔧 Editing Content Later

- **Menu items:** edit `assets/js/nav-data.js` (`NAV_ITEMS` array) — it drives both desktop sidebar and mobile drawer automatically.
- **Footer:** edit `assets/js/footer.js`.
- **Colours/fonts:** edit the `:root` variables at the top of `assets/css/style.css`.
- **Any page's text:** open that page's `.html` file directly — content is plain, readable HTML with Hindi headings marked by class `hi-head`.

## 📱 Responsiveness

Tested breakpoints: ≤560px (mobile), ≤900px (tablet), >900px (desktop). No horizontal scroll; sidebar becomes a hamburger + slide-in drawer below 900px; grids collapse from 3–4 columns → 2 → 1.
